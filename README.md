<h1>Importing downloded .obj files</h1>
Mainly for Roblox, the way you would go about doing this is first creating a mesh part:
<div>
 Next, you would click the folder button next to mesh, and import the model. (First part of model if several pieces.)
  If a pop-up shows up, click yes or else your model will look all jumbled.
  that's it.
